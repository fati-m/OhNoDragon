# OhNoDragon
A game in which you spawn inside a cave. You must navigate the cave's rooms to find the key to the treasure. You win once you get to the treasure room and you have the key. But be careful, there is a dragon that is lurking the rooms to find you!

# Rules:
1. You can only move to rooms adjacent to your current location
2. You cannot obtain the treasure if you have not yet found the key
3. You die if you are in the same room as the dragon
4. If you enter a portal room, you will automatically spawn to a random room

# How to Play:
1. Run the code
2. A window will pop up with an image of the room you spawn into and a list of adjacent rooms
3. Press a number on your keyboard to indicate which room you want to go to
4. Make sure to pay attention to the messages in the console. There will be warnings when there is a portal, dragon, or treasure room nearby as well as a message telling that you've obtained the key to the treasure or have been killed by the dragon.
